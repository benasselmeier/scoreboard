# Foosball Scoreboard

# If you're interested in contributing with your 10% time reach out to me on Teams!

An automatic scoreboard for the Viz game room's foosball table.

The scoreboard is written in Python and will run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W installed in the foosball table.

Scoring works with break-beam motion sensors to be installed inside the table.

Goals will eventually update a live web view for the scoreboard so viewers can see the score as well.
